Indexing a reference genome
---------------------------

To create an index for the [Lambda phage][2] reference genome included
with Bowtie 2:

    $ docker run -it -v $(pwd):/data bowtie-sci-app bowtie2-build \
        /examples/reference/lambda_virus.fa lambda_virus

The command should print many lines of output then quit. When the
command completes, the current directory will contain four new files
that all start with `lambda_virus` and end with `.1.bt2`, `.2.bt2`,
`.3.bt2`, `.4.bt2`, `.rev.1.bt2`, and `.rev.2.bt2`. These files
constitute the index.

Next, run:

    $ docker run -it -v $(pwd):/data bowtie-sci-app bowtie2 \
        -x lambda_virus -U /examples/reads/reads_1.fq -S eg1.sam

This runs the Bowtie 2 aligner, which aligns a set of unpaired reads
to the Lambda phage reference genome using the index generated in the
previous step. The alignment results in SAM format are written to the
file eg1.sam, and a short alignment summary is written to the
console. (Actually, the summary is written to the "standard error" or
"stderr" filehandle, which is typically printed to the console.)

To see the first few lines of the SAM output, run:

    $ head eg1.sam
